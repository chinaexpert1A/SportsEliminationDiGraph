# Sports Elimination Directed Graph by Andrew Taylor

This is a DiGraph built from the Python NetworkX package for my introductory Python course. The challenge was to use a table of space delimited values to calculate the max flow, and thus the championship eligibility, or elimination of a certain numnber of teams for which data is given. The code is generic in that it accepts an unlimited number of teams and corresponding matches.
